GPA_EndSample
@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Syntax
%%%%%%

.. code-block:: c++

    GPA_Status GPA_EndSample(
        GPA_CommandListId commandListId);

Description
%%%%%%%%%%%

Ends a sample in a command list. A sample is a particular workload for which
counters will be collected. If the owning session was created with
GPA_SESSION_SAMPLE_TYPE_DISCRETE_COUNTER and one or more counters have been
enabled, then those counters will be collected for this sample. Each sample
must be associated with a GPA command list. Samples can be created by using
multiple threads provided no two threads are creating samples on same command
list. You must provide a unique Id for every new sample. You may create as many
samples as needed. However, nesting of samples is not allowed. Each sample must
be wrapped in sequence of GPA_BeginSample/GPA_EndSample before starting another
one. A sample can be started in one primary command list and continued/ended on
another primary command list - See GPA_ContinueSampleOnCommandList.
