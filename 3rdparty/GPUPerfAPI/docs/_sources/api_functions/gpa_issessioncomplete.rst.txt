Syntax

.. code-block:: c++

    GPA_Status GPA_IsSessionComplete(
        GPA_SessionId sessionId);

Description
%%%%%%%%%%%

Checks if results for all samples within a session are available. After a
sampling session results may be available immediately or take a certain amount
of time to become available. This function allows you to determine when the
results of a session can be read. The function does not block, permitting
periodic polling. To block until a sample is ready use GPA_GetSampleResult
instead. Execution of all command lists (DirectX 12) or command buffers
(Vulkan) must be complete before results will be available.
